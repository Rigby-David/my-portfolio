          I love turning an idea into a reality through collaboration and code.
          With over 6 years experience as a lead installer in the specialty
          concrete resurfacing industry, and small businesses, I&apos;m excited
          to apply my leadership and technical skills to tech where my
          contributions will transform the world around me into a dynamic and
          accessible place for all.

        When I&apos;m not coding, you can find me at my local disc golf course,
        reading a fantasy novel, or working in my yard. Now, please enjoy this
        photo of my 9 month old lab mix, Petunia, doing a big blep.
